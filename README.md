# antennaTestRange

**antennaTestRange** is a Python-based software suite developed by the [Metamaterials and Antenna Research Squad (MARS)](https://carleton.ca/mars/) at Carleton University. It enables automated spherical antenna measurement and visualization using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and a dual-axis positioner.

This GUI-driven application allows users to configure, initiate, monitor, and store antenna radiation pattern data from spherical scans with real-time 3D visualization.
